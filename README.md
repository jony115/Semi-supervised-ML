This project will analyze textual data using natural language processing (NLP) 
techniques and machine learning algorithms to find patterns, attitudes, and trends that can provide a more 
in-depth insight of customer brand preferences.
The evaluation of the Supervised SVM Classifier on labeled data reveals several key insights into its performance across different emotional categories, as indicated by the micro-averaged F1 score of  approximately 0.52. The confusion matrix shows some misclassifications across different emotional categories, suggesting challenges in distinguishing certain emotions. The classifier exhibits relatively better 
performance in identifying 'joy' and 'neutral' emotions, with higher precision and recall scores. However, it 
struggles with categories like 'anger' and 'surprise,' demonstrating low precision and recall values. Emotions 
such as 'disgust,' 'fear,' and 'sadness' display moderate performance. While the classifier's accuracy stands 
at 0.52, aligning with the micro-averaged F1 score, there is room for improvement in its ability to 
differentiate and predict emotions accurately across all categories. The evaluation was conducted on a 
balanced dataset with 126 instances, ensuring unbiased performance metrics.
